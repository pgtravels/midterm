			<h1>Pet Photography Tips and Tricks </h1>
			<p> Great pet photography is about volume. You’ll need to take lots of pictures, and there will be plenty of duds, but among all those pics will be some gems. Here are more professional pet photography tips:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span id="first"> <strong>Get down to your pet’s level.</strong></span> Crouch down or lie on the floor rather than taking the photo from high overhead. And try a few shots where you get in close. If your pet is apt to back away, move in gradually with a treat ready or use a telephoto lens.</li>
				<li><span id="second"><strong>Focus on the eyes.</strong></span> The eyes are the window to the soul. Sounds corny but focusing on your pet’s eyes can help create an emotional connection with your viewer.</li>
				<li><strong>Avoid busy backgrounds.</strong> Be thoughtful about what’s behind and around your pet. You want your pet to be the center of attention. Plain white walls, a large patch of green grass, or a light or dark solid carpet to contrast your pet’s coat are all great options.</li>
				<li><span id="fourth"><strong>Use natural light.</strong></span>  Lots of natural light is best for pets who may get skittish around a flash. You can take photos of your dog outside or of your cat near a big sunny window.</li>
			</ul>
